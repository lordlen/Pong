# Pong
A two player game where you pass the ball to each other

## How to compile
You need SFML2 for this code to run. https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/. I personally used Visual Studio.

## Gameplay
Deflect the ball to your opponent. If a player fails to return the ball to his/her opponent, the opponent gains 1 point.
The trajectory of the ball depends on the direction the paddle is moving. For each return, the ball gets faster. The loser of the round gets to serve the ball.
